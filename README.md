# Greedy solution for multiset data structures
This application is for creating a multiset of data to achieve some targeted values.

The multisets that we are testing for solution are in the zip file, and at the moment the application works only with those data sets.

Download them and unzip the contect in your project folder. First line of each file has the m (attributes) value, the n (team/user) value and the best solution cost.
